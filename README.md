# Bill Calculator

## About
RK-ADE here! This project is created for my friends to use on their nightouts. We should be having fun instead of worrying about how to split the bill, hence, this is my answer to our problem.

Also, I wanted to practice using React. This is still a work in progress, and updates will surely be on the way. :P

## Project Description
